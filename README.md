## Backprogagation for two Output Neurons with one Input

This is an example of a very simple neural network with one input, x, and two output neurons, N_1 and N_2. The sigmoid activation function is used. In this example we try to classify 1-D data points which are drawn from two different Gaussians, with mean and variance (-5, 1) and (5, 1), respectively.
